    A basic connection pool for DB-API 2.0-compliant database drivers.

    Example usage:

            'server': 'my-host',
            'database': 'MyDefaultDatabase',

    .. versionadded:: 1.2

    .. note:: Idle connection collection only occurs during calls to
        :py:meth:`.acquire()` and does not happen automatically in the
        background.

    :param dbapi2: The DB-API 2 module used to create connections.
        This module must implement the :pep:`0249` specification.

    :param dict params: Connection parameters to pass directly to the
        :pep:`0249#connect` method when creating a new connection.

    :param float idlettl: The maximum time, in seconds, a connection can sit
        idle before it is discarded. If not specified, connections are retained
        indefinitely.

    :param int maxsize: The maximum number of connections to keep in
        the pool.

    :param bool block: Block until a connection is released back to the
        pool? This is only applicable when a `maxsize` value is specified. If
        `False`, a new connection will be created as needed, but the number of
        connections retained in the pool will never exceed `maxsize`.
