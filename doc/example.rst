Basic Example
=============

All interactions with *cTDS* first require a connection. Connections
are created using the :func:`ctds.connect` method. All
:py:class:`ctds.Connection` objects can be used as context managers
in a `with <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0343/>`_ statement.

In order to actually perform queries or called stored procedures,
a :py:class:`ctds.Cursor` is required. This can be acquired using the
:py:func:`ctds.Connection.cursor` method. Like the :py:class:`ctds.Connection`
object, the :py:class:`ctds.Cursor` object can also be used as a context
manager.

.. note::

    Due to the design of the *TDS* protocol, :py:class:`ctds.Cursor` objects
    cannot have multiple query results active at once. Only the results from
    the last query are available from the :py:class:`ctds.Cursor`.


An example of a simple query follows:

.. code-block:: python

    import ctds

    connection = ctds.connect(
        'my-database-host',
        user='username',
        password='password'
    )
    with connection:
        with connection.cursor() as cursor:
            cursor.execute('SELECT @@VERSION AS Version')
            row = cursor.fetchone()

    # Columns can be accessed by index, name, or attribute.
    assert row[0] == row['Version']
    print(row.Version)
    
Microsoft Azure SQL Datawarehouse Connections
----------------------------------------------

With Microsoft Azure SQL Datawarehouse you need to make sure the TDS Version 7.3 is being used. Failure to do so will result in connection failure with an error message similar to `Adaptive connection failed.`

To set the TDS version to 7.3, add the `tds_version` paramter to the `connect` method.

.. code-block:: python

    connection = ctds.connect(
        ...,
        tds_version='7.3'
    )
