All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.
This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]
### Added
- Offical support for Python 3.9.
- Expose `ctds.Row` type so that it can be used as a type annotation.

## [1.12.0] - 2020-03-07
### Fixed
- Fixed Python -> SQL type conversion to consider client TDS version when
choosing SQL type. https://github.com/zillow/ctds/issues/68.
- Added Sphinx extension to auto-generate the `.nojekyll` file required
by Github pages.
- Consolidate coverage output to a single directory.

## [1.11.0] - 2019-11-14
### Added
- Official support for Python3.8.
- Automate Python egg publishing to pypi.
- Automate documentation publishing.

### Fixed
- Fix handling of `IDENTITY` columns in `ctds.Connection.bulk_insert()`.
https://github.com/zillow/ctds/issues/59.

## [1.10.1] - 2019-06-27
### Fixed
- Properly handle errors in the `ctds.pool.ConnectionPool.connection` context
manager.

## [1.10.0] - 2019-04-15
### Added
- Add FreeTDS 1.1 to test matrix.

### Fixed
- Preserve microsecond precision of _TIME_ and _DATETIME2_ SQL types when
converting to Python (and supported by FreeTDS).
- Fix improper conversion of empty strings to `NULL` in
`ctds.Connection.bulk_insert()`.
https://github.com/zillow/ctds/issues/35.

## [1.9.0] - 2018-11-05
### Added
- Add support for passing sequences of `dict` values to
`ctds.Connection.bulk_insert`. The mapping key is used to determine the column
order based on the column info available after `bcp_init`.
https://github.com/zillow/ctds/issues/38

### Fixed
- Fix truncation of strings containing multi-byte sequences when not using
`sp_executesql`.
- Fix `ctds.Cursor.executemany()` truncating data for integer types.
https://github.com/zillow/ctds/issues/43.

## [1.8.0] - 2018-09-07
### Added
- Official support for Python 3.7.
- Add optional `hostname` parameter to `ctds.connect()`.
https://github.com/zillow/ctds/issues/20.
- Add optional `ntlmv2` parameter to `ctds.connect()`.
https://github.com/zillow/ctds/issues/27.

### Fixed
- Retry on SQL Server unittest database setup failures due to race conditions
when starting SQL Server. This should make the unit tests much more reliable.
- Add `python_requires` specifier to *setup.py*.
- Properly handle decimal.Decimal values specified in scientific notation.
- Properly set autocommit in `ctds.connect()`, even when `ansi_defaults` is
`False`.
- Download FreeTDS packages from HTTP URL for compatibility with Travis CI
builds (FTP no longer works due to firewall issues.)
- Fix OS X Travis CI build.
- Improve SQL Server -> DB API 2.0 error mappings.
https://github.com/zillow/ctds/issues/12
- Remove Python 2.6 from Appveyor CI due to lack of support.
- Fix `ctds.Cursor.executemany()` truncating data for variable width types.
https://github.com/zillow/ctds/issues/25.

## [1.7.0] - 2018-01-24
### Added
- Add rich comparison support and `repr` to `ctds.Parameter`.

### Fixed
- Compiler warnings on older version of gcc.
- Debug assert when passing invalid parameters to `ctds.Cursor.execute*()`.

## [1.6.3] - 2017-12-05
### Fixed
- Raise proper warning from `ctds.Connection.messages`.

## [1.6.2] - 2017-11-27
### Fixed
- Support values longer than 8000 characters in `ctds.SqlVarChar`.

## [1.6.1] - 2017-11-20
### Fixed
- Revert passing BINARY 0x00 for (N)VARCHAR arguments.

## [1.6.0] - 2017-11-17
### Added
- Documentation improvements.
- Add an optional *paramstyle* argument to `ctds.connect`, with support
for the `named` *paramstyle*.
- Add valgrind support for memory leak detection and integrate it into the CI
build process (Travis only).
- Add optional `read_only` argument to `ctds.connect` for indication of
read-only intent. Note: Requires as yet unreleased FreeTDS support.
### Fixed
- Pass a BINARY 0x00 byte instead of an empty string for (N)VARCHAR arguments.
This is to work around the inability of the db-lib API to pass empty string
parameters via RPC.

## [1.5.0] - 2017-10-16
### Added
- Windows support, with Appveyor continuous integration.
- Python egg-related metadata checks.
- Moved source code under ./src directory, per best practices.

## [1.4.1] - 2017-09-29
### Fixed
- Only clear `Connection.messages` on calls to `execute`, `executemany`
or `callproc`. Add support for raising multiple non-zero severity
messages as warnings.

## [1.4.0] - 2017-09-13
### Fixed
- Changed the implementation of `Cursor.execute` to only perform
parameter substitution if parameters are provided. When no parameters
are passed, the SQL format string is treated as raw SQL.
### Added
- `Connection.messages` read-only property.
- Improved code coverage.

## [1.3.2] - 2017-07-25
### Fixed
- Register RowListType to support pickling/unpickling.
### Added
- Convert test framework to use Docker-based containers for
SQL Server and for each supported combination of Python and FreeTDS.
- Integrate [codecov](https://codecov.io/) support for code coverage
tracking.
- Move documentation hosting to [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/).
- Include change log in generated documentation.

## [1.3.1] - 2017-05-31
### Fixed
- Fix connection failures when connecting to high port numbers on OS X.
- Fix unit test infrastructure to respect configured port number.
- Work around inconsistencies between FreeTDS versions in the bcp_getl/
BCP_SETL interfaces.

## [1.3.0] - 2017-03-15
### Fixed
- Replace usage of the deprecated `PyErr_Warn` API with `PyErr_WarnEx`.
This will allow clients to indicate that warnings should be raised as
exceptions.

## [1.2.3] - 2017-03-13
### Fixed
- Improve `repr` implementation for SQL type wrapper objects.
- Fixed informational (warning) message reporting where many SQL Server
reported messages were not reported as warnings due if not returned to
the client promptly enough.

## [1.2.2] - 2017-01-10
### Fixed
- Fix multi-byte UTF-16 character conversion.

## [1.2.1] - 2016-12-27
### Fixed
- Include `ctds.pool` in egg package.

## [1.2.0] - 2016-12-27
### Fixed
- Documentation improvements around *(N)VARCHAR* handling.

### Added
- `ctds.pool.ConnectionPool` class.
- Support the `in` keyword for resultset rows.
- Add code coverage support for Python code.
- Improve code coverage support for c code.

## [1.1.0] - 2016-11-14
### Added
- `ctds.SqlNVarChar` type.
- Ignore the replacement parameter markers inside of string literals in
SQL statements passed to `ctds.Cursor.execute()` and
`ctds.Cursor.executemany()`.

### Fixed
- Work around a Memory leak in FreeTDS when specifying the database at
connection time.
- Fixed failure in `ctds.Cursor.execute()` and `ctds.Cursor.executemany()`
when passing a SQL statement longer than 4000 characters.

## [1.0.8] - 2016-08-17
### Fixed
- Configure connections to use UTF-16 when supported (i.e. FreeTDS 1.00+).
Don't replace codepoints outside of the UCS-2 range if the connection is
using UTF-16 as it is no longer necessary and causes data loss.

## [1.0.7] - 2016-08-15
### Fixed
- Only use strict compile options for debug/development builds. Allow
the client (e.g. pip) to specify the desired options when installing as an
egg.

## [1.0.6] - 2016-08-15
### Fixed
- Compile under the *c90* standard for better future portability.
- Don't overwrite more useful error messages with the useless "The statement
has been terminated." error.

### Added
- Minor documentation improvements.

## [1.0.5] - 2016-05-23
### Fixed
- Fix the `ctds.Connection.timeout` property to raise an appropriate error
when the option is supported, but the set fails.

## [1.0.4] - 2016-05-19
### Fixed
- Fix the `ctds.Connection.timeout` property to work with the **DBSETTIME**
option added in [FreeTDS](https://www.freetds.org) version *1.00*.

### Added
- Support for TDS version *7.4*, introduced with [FreeTDS](https://www.freetds.org)
version *1.00*.

## [1.0.3] - 2016-03-31
### Fixed
- Fix [execute()](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0249/#execute) and
[executemany()](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0249/#executemany) to work
with older versions of [FreeTDS](https://www.freetds.org) (prior to 0.92.405).
Format the SQL command manually, instead of using **sp_executesql**, since
older versions of [FreeTDS](https://www.freetds.org) don't seem to support passing
_NVARCHAR_ arguments to remote procedure calls.

### Added
- Transaction documentation
- Bulk insert documentation

## [1.0.2] - 2016-03-15
### Fixed
- Documentation typos and improvements

### Added
- [travis-ci](https://travis-ci.org/zillow/ctds) integration

## [1.0.1] - 2016-03-14
### Fixed
- Build on OS X

### Added
- Hypothetical integration with readthdocs.org

## [1.0.0] - 2016-03-14
